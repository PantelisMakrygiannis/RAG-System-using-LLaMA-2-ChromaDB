# RAG-System-using-LLaMA-2-ChromaDB
This project implements a Question-Answering (QA) System that extracts knowledge from scientific papers and answers user queries using LLaMA-2 and ChromaDB. The pipeline enables document parsing, text chunking, vector embedding, and context-based response generation without relying on pre-trained QA pairs.
